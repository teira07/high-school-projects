# high-school-projects
This repository compiles all of the coding projects I completed during my two years in Bachillerato. The projects here include both personal projects and assignments completed for class. This collection showcases my progression and development as I learned how to code for the first time in various programming languages. The primary goal of this repository is to showcase the skills I have gained and provide a way to reflect on my growth as a programmer over time.
